<SignPostConfig version="22">

   <!--
      The SignPost width and height should fit, together with the outline and contrast borders,
      into the ISM view port, whose dimensions are defined in IsmViewConfig.xml This file is
      currently located in tsd.mibstd2.nav.config.data/<region>/<model>/nav/map/view/,
      that is, for example tsd.mibstd2.nav.config.data/EU/default/nav/map/view/IsmViewConfig.xml.

      The current view port size is set to 284 x 275 pixels.
      If the SignPost is to have no space between its outline and contrast border and the
      view port border, then its width would be

         SignPost width = viewport width - 2 x Outline thickness - 2 x Contrast thickness,
         here SignPost width = 284 - 2 x 2 - 2 x 2 = 276,
         and so on...

      The RoadIcon, whose exact dimensions are only known at run time, is VERTICALLY CENTERED.
      The parameters "x" and "y" denote NOT the position of its center, but rather the space
      desired to the left and to the right of the icon within the SignPost.

      The Road Sign text, whose exact dimensions are only known at run time, is VERTICALLY CENTERED.
      The parameters "x" and "y" denote NOT the position of its center, but rather the space
      desired to the left and to the right of the text within the SignPost.
      Note: The "x" parameter adds to the "y" parameter of the road icon.

      The Contrast thickness will, for the time being, be equivalent to the Outline thickness.
