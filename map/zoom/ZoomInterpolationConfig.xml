   Description:
      The <ZoomInterpolationConfig> contains the configuration for the auto zoom behavior.

      <ZoomIntervalMs>
         This tag is used to define the basic zoom period. In case the user decides to trigger the zooming,
         the following zoom process will take this time period to finish. There is an exception to this.
         If the user changes the zoom level while the zoom process, then the zoom period will be extended
         by the full value of the tag.
         Zooming from one level to another is performed in three phases.
         Default: 2000 ms.

      <ZoomStartIntervalMs>
         Time in milliseconds denoting how long the first zoom phase should last.
         Default: 666 ms (i.e. one-third of the total zoom interval).
         Range: (0; ZoomIntervalMs)

      <ZoomEndIntervalMs>
         Time in milliseconds denoting how long the last zoom phase should last.
         Default: 666 ms (i.e. one-third of the total zoom interval).
         Range: (0; ZoomIntervalMs)

      <ZoomStartPercentage>
         Percentage of the target zoom level which should be reached at the end of the first zoom phase
         and at which the middle phase starts.
         Default: 20%.

      <ZoomEndPercentage>
         Percentage of the target zoom level which is reached after the middle zoom phase and at which the
         last phase starts.
         Default: 80%.

      <WaitingForInputIntervalMs>
         This tag is used to define how many milliseconds the system will wait after each zoom command
         before the actual zooming begins.
         Default: 100 ms.

      <DelayBetweenZoomUpdatesMs>
         This tag is used to define how often the zoom recommendation is propagated to the HMI. The system
         will wait at least this amount of time after each zoom recommendation before sending a new one.
         Default: 500 ms.
                 
      <ZoomInHysteresis>
         Increasing this value (in zoom levels) may result in map "resisting" zooming out during auto zoom
         when it was automatically zooming in before. So if speed or maneuver based zoom was zooming in
         and want to zoom out it must zoom out at least <ZoomInHysteresis> zoom levels before the zooming
         takes any effect.

      <ZoomOutHysteresis>
         Similar to <ZoomInHysteresis>
