   Description:

   The <SkyHorizonConfig> contains a description of images to be used for
   displaying the sky and horizon on the map.

   <SkyImages>
      Images to be used for the sky background image.  The sky image scrolls
      in the horizontal direction depending on the camera and north-up direction
      angle.
      Usually two <Image> nodes, with mode="day" and "mode"night" are specified.
      If an image for one of the mode is not specified, no image will be
      displayed in that mode.
      Two pptional attributes are supported 'anchor_x' and 'anchor_y', which
      allow the position of the image on the screen to be adjusted.  The units
      for the anchor are pixels.  The default values are anchor_x="0" and
      anchor_y="0".

   <HorizonImages>
      Images to be used for the horizon/fog background image, that is displayed
      on top of the sky image.  The horizon image does not scroll in the
      horizontal direction.
      Usually two <Image> nodes, with mode="day" and "mode"night" are specified.
      If an image for one of the mode is not specified, no image will be
      displayed in that mode.
      Two pptional attributes are supported 'anchor_x' and 'anchor_y', which
      allow the position of the image on the screen to be adjusted.  The units
      for the anchor are pixels.  The default values are anchor_x="0" and
      anchor_y="88" (SOP1 compatibility value).

   <SkyHeight>
      A list of nodes that specify how many percent of the screen will be
      covered by the sky images at which camera tilt angles.
